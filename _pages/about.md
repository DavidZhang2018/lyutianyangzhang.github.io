Research Project

IEEE 802.11ax/be Link-Level Simulator Design and Optimized Channel Sounding                      University of Washington Matlab, Seattle, WA
                                                                                                                           Advisor: Sumit Roy

This simulator is design for full phy layer plus frame level packet exchange for IEEE 802.11ac/ax/be performance analysis on
packet level emphasizing channel sounding considering time-varying IEEE channel model. The channel sounding period optimization is one of the major advancing direction in next-Gen WiFi system because the channel sounding period and the correspondingly introduced overhead can impact the overall network throughput
significantly. In this project, channel sounding period problem is formulated as a non-convex problem, which brings huge challenge to
optimal channel sounding period. Optimization theory, machine learning techniques are utilized to propose the algorithm to pinpoint the globally optimal
channel sounding period with high time-complexity and sub-optimal channel sounding period with lower time-complexity for
universal WiFi systems.

Efficient PHY Layer Abstraction under Imperfect Channel Estimation for Wi-Fi and B5G Systems      University of Washington Python/NS3-3, Seattle, WA 
                                                                                                                  Advisor: Sumit Roy, Tom Henderson

As network simulators such as NS3 have been suffering from the large computational complexity in the physical (PHY) layer,
a PHY layer abstraction model that efficiently and accurately characterizes the PHY layer performance from the system level
simulations is well-needed. This project improves an efficient PHY layer method, EESM-log-SGN PHY layer abstraction, by
considering the presence of channel estimation error. Finally, the developed methods are validated under different orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) scenarios.
