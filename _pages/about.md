Research Project
------
IEEE 802.11ax/be Link-Level Simulator Design and Optimized Channel Sounding            University of Washington Matlab, Seattle, WA
                                                                                                                 Advisor: Sumit Roy

This simulator is design for full phy layer plus frame level packet exchange for IEEE 802.11ac/ax/be performance analysis on
packet level emphasizing channel sounding considering time-varying IEEE channel model. The channel sounding period optimization is one of the major advancing direction in next-Gen WiFi system because the channel sounding period and the correspondingly introduced overhead can impact the overall network throughput
significantly. In this project, channel sounding period problem is formulated as a non-convex problem, which brings huge challenge to
optimal channel sounding period. Optimization theory, machine learning techniques are utilized to propose the algorithm to pinpoint the globally optimal
channel sounding period with high time-complexity and sub-optimal channel sounding period with lower time-complexity for
universal WiFi systems.




**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
